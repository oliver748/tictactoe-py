# tictactoe
Play Tic-Tac-Toe with your friend (or yourself) in Python using no additional libraries/packages/modules.

It's currently not possible to move pieces but this will be implemented soon; also this code is kind of jank but I wanted to see my code improve more and more as I make updates. It still functions perfectly so don't worry about that!

Also, sorry for the lack of comments in the code :(

# Instructions
1. Git clone or download this repo
2. Run main.py
3. Enjoy
